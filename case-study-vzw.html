			<h3 class="title-3">The Challenge</h3>
			<p class="large space-2">Verizon is an industry giant, very well known for its wireless business and its broad reaching service across the USA. It has diverse networks and data centers distributed across the world, which also help orchestrate enteprise solutions on the cloud. With resources spread across the world new problems arise: 
        
			<li class="large space-2">Managing a cloud isn't easy and teams often build tools to automate recurring manual tasks. Often the same tasks are being replicated by other teams resulting inefficiencies</li>
			<li class="large">Applications built do not follow any design guideline and user requirements get buried when engineers attend to their primary roles in their respective teams</li>

			</p>
			<h3 class="title-3 space-4">The Solution</h3>
			<p class="large space-2">
        The prayers were answered and a new team was built to create a platform that automate services for different teams manage the cloud. We helped
        manage tickets to host applications, troubleshooting the health and status of servers at the data centers and a knowledge base for common tasks. 
         
			</p>
			<li class="large space-1">As a developer with a design background, I spent time with managers and engineers across departments to identify their problems</li>
			<li class="large">Creating mockups and prototypes that are tested internally and externally with teams</li>
      <li class="large">Creating and maintaining design standards for building operation tools and dashboards</li>
      <li class="large">Developing features used on a daily basis by engineers at control rooms to cubes</li>
      <li class="large">Actively gathering feedback and iterating new features into the platform</li>

			<h3 class="title-3 space-4">My Toolbox</h3>
			<h4 class="title-4 space-2 brand-blue">Design</h4>
				<li class="large space-1">Design workshops to brainstorm and prototype</li>
				<li class="large ">Sketch</li>
				<li class="large">React.js and Redux</li>
				<li class="large">Express.js and Node.js</li>
